This project was made to exhibit my knowledge so far regarding HTML and CSS.

The goal of this project is to establish my fundamentals in HTML and CSS by creating a website while following a design reference.

Special thanks to these awesome photographers for sharing with me their excellent art via Unsplash to make my website life-like:
